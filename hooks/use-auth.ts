// This hook is provided by the AuthContext, so no separate file is needed here.
// The AuthContext already exports `useAuth` which provides `dbUser` (currentUser), `login`, `logout`, `register` (signUp), etc.
// I will ensure the AuthContext file (`contexts/auth-context.tsx`) matches the requested exports.
